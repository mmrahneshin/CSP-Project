# CSP Project

This repository contains an implementation of a **Constraint Satisfaction Problem (CSP)** project, including the following components:

- **Java Source Code**: Implementation of the CSP in 3 Java files.
- **Text Files**: Additional configuration or data files in `.txt` format.
- **Git Metadata**: Includes hooks, references, and configuration files for version control.
- **Sample Scripts**: Reference `.sample` scripts, typically for Git hooks.

The project explores solving CSPs using algorithmic approaches, with supporting documentation and implementation.
